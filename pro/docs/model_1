# UAV Path Planning using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements a UAV path planning system using Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the optimal path in a grid environment with obstacles.

## Overview

The UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) will navigate through a grid environment from a start point to a goal point. The grid contains obstacles, and the algorithm aims to find the shortest path around them using Dijkstra's algorithm, ensuring the UAV avoids blocked cells.

## Features

- Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal pathfinding
- 2D grid environment with obstacles
- Visualization of the path on the grid

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib (for path visualization)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uav_path_planning.git
   cd uav_path_planning
